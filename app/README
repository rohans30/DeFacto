1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from within the app folder
2. Don't forget to set the API key by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY="{your_api_key}"` in the terminal.
3. To run `app.py` run `streamlit run app.py`.
4. To run `app_gradio.py` run `python app_gradio.py`

- All the prompts and descriptions are in `constants.py`

- `app.py` implements the UI using streamlit. The chats are going back and forth
but we need to debug and figure out why they aren't showing up on the UI.
Right now it only shows a couple of the initial messages, and it never displays a
message sent by the user. Debugging this is our best bet.

- `app_gradio.py` implements the UI in gradio. It doesn't show the messages in the UI
but you can see the messages in the terminal.

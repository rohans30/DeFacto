# DeFacto

## Team LLaw-Ma's CS 294 Project

DeFacto is a Multi Agent Application capable of simulating court cases, analyzing legal documents, and preparing the next generation of attorneys.

To run the application start 2 terminals. Navigate to the frontend and backend directories, located at
defacto_app/frontend and defacto_app/backend.

1. For the frontend, there is a separate README file in the directory to help you install the necessary dependencies and run "npm run dev"

2. For the backend, there is a separate README file in the directory to help you install the necessary dependencies  and run "uvicorn app:app --reload"

3. Once these are both running, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the application!

Thank you for looking at our project. We hope you enjoyed!

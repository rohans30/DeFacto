My defendant is innocent and I will prove it this court. Defendant, please come to the stand and tell the court where you were on the night of the incident.

Your Honor, members of the jury, the prosecution acknowledges that the defendant believed they were following the law by moving into the center lane. However, **Minn. Stat. §169.18, subd. 11 (2002)**, known as the **Ted Foss Move Over Law**, clearly states that when a driver approaches a stopped emergency vehicle with its lights flashing, the driver must "safely move the vehicle to a lane away from the emergency vehicle."  The law makes no mention of the driver's **intent** or **good-faith belief**. In cases involving traffic statutes like this one, courts have routinely held that **traffic violations are considered 'strict liability offenses'**, meaning that a driver may still be found guilty **regardless of intent or knowledge of wrongdoing**, as long as the prohibited act occurred.  **Precedent Reference:** In *State v. Johnson, 634 N.W.2d 194 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001)*, the court affirmed that when public safety laws are involved, compliance is measured **objectively** by the driver's actions, **not their interpretation** of the law. Applying that standard here, the center lane **did not create a safe buffer** as required by the statute.

I would like to call **Officer Jordan Yang** to testify about the exact distance between the defendant’s vehicle and the emergency vehicle. Officer Yang, how close was the defendant's vehicle when it passed your squad car, and would moving to the leftmost lane have provided greater safety for yourself and others on the scene?

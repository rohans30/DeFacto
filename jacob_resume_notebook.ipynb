Just before reaching Walnut Street, I had to slow down because there was a squad car parked behind another car in the bike lane. The squad car was sticking out into the traffic lane a bit, while the other car was parked close to the curb. I saw a car, which I later learned was driven by the defendant, change lanes from the right lane into the center lane to drive around the parked cars. After the defendant's car passed, I went around the cars. Moments later, the squad car passed me with its emergency lights on, and I saw the officer pull the defendant over.\n",
